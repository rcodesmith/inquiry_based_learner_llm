# Claude API Interaction Project

This project demonstrates how to interact with Claude's generative text models using the Anthropic API in a Jupyter notebook.

## Setup

1. Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Anthropic API key:

```
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

3. Run the Jupyter notebook:

```
jupyter notebook
```

4. Open the `notebooks/claude_interaction.ipynb` file and start interacting with Claude!

## Project Structure

- `notebooks/`: Contains Jupyter notebooks for interacting with Claude.
- `src/`: Contains the Python module for API interaction.
- `tests/`: Unit tests
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the required Python packages.
- `.env`: Stores the Anthropic API key (not tracked by git).
